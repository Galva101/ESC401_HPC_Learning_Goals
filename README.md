# ESC401 Learning Goals

This is my summary of exam topics for the course *ESC401 High Performance Computing* at the University of Zurich, which took place in fall of 2023.
I tried to answer all the points on the Learning Goals list that was handed out towards the end of the semester.
Moreover, I also included some other topics that were covered in the lecture.
